# ðŸ§® Basic Division App (C# Console)

## ðŸ“‹ Description

This is a simple C# console application that takes two numbers from the user and performs a division operation. It includes built-in error handling to gracefully manage issues such as:

- Invalid input (non-numeric)
- Division by zero

The program demonstrates basic use of:
- `Console.ReadLine()` and `Console.WriteLine()`
- `int.Parse()`
- `try-catch` for exception handling

- Accepts two integer inputs from the user
- Divides the first number by the second
- Catches and displays any errors that occur (e.g., invalid input, divide by zero)

2. Build and run the application.
